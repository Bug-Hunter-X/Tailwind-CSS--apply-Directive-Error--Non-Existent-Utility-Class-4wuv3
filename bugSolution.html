The solution is to ensure that the utility class `text-gray-900` is correctly defined in your `tailwind.config.js` file.  If you want to use it, you would add it to your `tailwind.config.js` file's `theme` section or ensure that the correct plugins are installed and configured, then purge or build your CSS to ensure it is included. For this example, `text-gray-900` is a standard Tailwind utility and should already be available.

This corrected code assumes `text-gray-900` is a valid Tailwind class:

```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 text-gray-900">
</div>
```

Using `@apply` is still possible, but only after confirming the class exists:
```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 @apply text-gray-900">
</div>
```

Remember to rebuild your CSS after making changes to your `tailwind.config.js`.
